# This script explains the root of my personal organization folders (based on PARA)
# and creates the proper associated directories in my home directory

# Directories names should :
# 1. Use consistent syntaxâ€¯: always singular, camelCase, ASCII alphanumeric, mostly nouns
# 2. Sort alphabetically from the least to most actionable
# 3. Be as short as possible while also as unambiguous as possible

# Sub-directories corresponding to *.git or *.large
# should not be synced with lower capacity devices

# TODO make this script idempotent
